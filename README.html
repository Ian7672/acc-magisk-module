<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>ACC is an Android software mainly intended for <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries">extending battery service life</a>.
In a nutshell, this is achieved through limiting charging current, temperature, and voltage.
Any root solution is supported.
Regardless of whether the system is rooted with Magisk, the installation is always "systemless".</p>

<h2>DISCLAIMER</h2>

<p>Always read/reread this reference prior to installing/upgrading this software.</p>

<p>While no cats have been harmed, the author assumes no responsibility for anything that might break due to the use/misuse of it.</p>

<p>To prevent fraud, do NOT mirror any link associated with this project.

<hr />

<h2>WARNINGS</h2>

<p>ACC manipulates Android low level (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=kernel+android">kernel</a>) parameters which control the charging circuitry.
The author assumes no responsibility under anything that might break due to the use/misuse of this software.
By choosing to use/misuse it, you agree to do so at your own risk!</p>

<p>Some devices, notably from Xiaomi, have a buggy PMIC (Power Management Integrated Circuit) that can be triggered by acc.
The issue blocks charging.
Ensure your battery does not discharge too low.
Using acc's auto shutdown feature is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-official-arrowos-11-0-android-11-0-vayu-bhima.4267263/post-85119331">this XDA post</a> for additional details.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/lybxlpsv">lybxlpsv</a> suggests booting into bootloader and then back into system to reset the PMIC.</p>

<hr />

<h2>DONATIONS</h2>

<p>Please, support the project with donations (<a href="#links">links</a> at the bottom).
As the project gets bigger and more popular, the need for coffee goes up as well.</p>

Precedence: /data/adb/vr25/bin/busybox > Magisk's busybox > system's busybox</p>

<p>Other executables or static binaries can also be placed in /data/adb/vr25/bin/ (with proper permissions) instead of being installed system-wide.</p>

<hr />

<h2>QUICK START GUIDE</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>All commands/actions require root.</p></li>
<li><p>Install/upgrade: flash* the zip or use a front-end app.
There are two additional ways of upgrading: <code>acc --upgrade</code> (online) and <code>acc --flash</code> (zip flasher).
Rebooting after installation/removal is generally unnecessary.
Manual uninstall before upgrade is unnecessary.</p></li>
<li><p>[Optional] run <code>acc</code> (wizard). That's the main command to remember.</p></li>
<li><p>[Optional] run <code>acc pause_capacity resume_capacity</code> (default <code>75 70</code>) to set the battery levels at which charging should pause and resume, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>If you come across any issues, refer to the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a>, <a href="#tips">tips</a> and <a href="#frequently-asked-questions-faq">FAQ</a> sections below.
Read as much as you can, prior to reporting issues and/or asking questions.
Oftentimes, solutions/answers will be right before your eyes.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Steps <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> are optional because there are default settings.
For details, refer to the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> section below.
Users are encouraged to try step <code>2</code> - to familiarize themselves with the available options.</p>

<p>Settings can be overwhelming. Start with what you understand.
The default configuration has you covered.
Don't ever feel like you have to configure everything. You probably shouldn't anyway - unless you really know what you're doing.</p>

<p>Uninstall: run <code>acc --uninstall</code> or flash* <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc-data/acc-uninstaller.zip</code>.</p>

<p>ACC runs in some recovery environments as well.
Unless the zip is flashed again, manual initialization is required.
The initialization command is <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc/service.sh</code>.</p>

<h2>BUILDING AND/OR INSTALLING FROM SOURCE</h2>

<h3>Dependencies (Build)</h3>

<ul>
<li>git, wget, or curl (pick one)</li>
<li>zip</li>
</ul>

<h3>Build Tarballs and Flashable Zips</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Download and extract the source code: <code>git clone https://github.com/VR-25/acc.git</code>
or <code>wget  https://github.com/VR-25/acc/archive/master.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz</code>
or <code>curl -L#  https://github.com/VR-25/acc/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>cd acc*</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>sh build.sh</code> (or double-click <code>build.bat</code> on Windows 10, if you have Windows subsystem for Linux (with zip) installed)</p></li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>build.sh automatically sets/corrects <code>id=*</code> in <code>*.sh</code> and <code>update-binary</code> files.
Refer to framework-details.txt for a full list of tasks carried out by it.
To skip generating archives, run the build script with a random argument (e.g. bash build.sh h).</p></li>
<li><p>To update the local source code, run <code>git pull --force</code> or re-download it (with wget/curl) as described above.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Install from Local Source or GitHub</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><code>[export installDir=&lt;parent install dir&gt;] sh install.sh</code> installs acc from the extracted source.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sh install-online.sh [-c|--changelog] [-f|--force] [-k|--insecure] [-n|--non-interactive] [%parent install dir%] [commit]</code> downloads and installs acc from GitHub - e.g., <code>sh install-online.sh dev</code>.
The order of arguments doesn't matter.
For upgrades, if <code>%parent install dir%</code> is not supplied, the original/current is used.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sh install-tarball.sh [module id, default: acc] [parent install dir (e.g., /data/data/mattecarra.accapp/files)]</code> installs the tarball (acc*gz) from the script's location.
The archive must be in the same directory as this script - and obtained from GitHub: https://github.com/VR-25/acc/archive/$commit.tar.gz ($commit examples: master, dev, v2020.5.20-rc).</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
<li><p><code>install-online.sh</code> is the <code>acc --upgrade</code> back-end.</p></li>
<li><p>The default parent installation directories, in order of priority, are: <code>/data/data/mattecarra.accapp/files/</code> (ACC App, but only if Magisk is not installed), <code>/data/adb/modules/</code> (Magisk) and <code>/data/adb/</code> (other root solutions).</p></li>
<li><p>No argument/option is strictly mandatory.
The exception is <code>--non-interactive</code> for front-end apps.</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>--force</code> option to <code>install-online.sh</code> is meant for re-installation and downgrading.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sh install-online.sh --changelog --non-interactive</code> prints the version code (integer) and changelog URL (string) when an update is available.
In interactive mode, it also asks the user whether they want to download and install the update.</p></li>
<li><p>You may also want to read <a href="#terminal-commands">Terminal Commands</a> > <code>Exit Codes</code> below.</p></li>

<p>// WARNINGS</p>

<p>// Do not edit this in Windows Notepad, ever!
// It replaces LF (Linux/Unix) with CRLF (Windows) line endings.</p>

<p>// Nullifying values that should not be null causes unexpected behavior.
// However, doing so with "--set var=" restores the default value of "var".
// In other words, for regular users, "--set" is safer than modifying the config file directly.</p>

<p>// Do not feel like you must configure everything!

<p>// NOTES</p>

<p>// The daemon does not have to be restarted after making changes to this file - unless one of the changes is charging_switch.</p>

<p>// A change to current_workaround (cw) only takes effect after an acc [re]initialization.
// Install, upgrade, "accd --init" and system reboot actions always [re]initialize acc.</p>

<p>// If those 2 variables are updated with "acc --set" (does NOT apply to acca --set), accd is restarted automatically (--init is implied, as needed).</p>

<p>// FINE, BUT WHAT DOES EACH OF THESE VARIABLES ACTUALLY MEAN?</p>

<p>// configVerCode #
// This is checked during updates to determine whether the config should be patched. Do NOT modify.
// The value is not necessarily the same as acc version code.</p>

<p>// amp<em>factor (af) # Default: null
// volt</em>factor (vf) #
// Unit multiplier for conversion (e.g., 1V = 1000000 microvolts).
// ACC can automatically determine the units, but the mechanism is not 100% foolproof.
// Leave those properties alone, unless current/voltage info is wrong.</p>

<p>// apply<em>on</em>boot (ab) # Default: null
// Kernel settings to apply on boot and on daemon start/restart.
// The --exit flag (refer back to applyOnBoot=...) tells the daemon to stop after applying settings.
// If that flag is not included, default values are restored when the daemon stops.</p>

<p>// apply<em>on</em>plug (ap) # Default: null
// Kernel settings to apply on plug.
// This exists because certain devices reset control files (e.g., current_max) when the charger is re-plugged.
// Default values are restored when the daemon stops.</p>

<p>// batt<em>status</em>override (bso) # Default: null</p>

<p>// Overrides the battery status determined by the not_charging function.
// It can be Idle, Discharging (both case sensitive), or logic to PRINT the desired value for the _status variable.
// When set to Idle or Discharging, _status will be set to that value if the enforced* charging switch state is off.
// It only works in conjunction with an enforced charging switch (set manually, has a trailing " --").</p>

<p>// Usage scenario: the switch "main/cool<em>mode 0 1" supports idle mode. However, sometimes it does not respond soon enough (e.g., due to fast charging). The user can then enforce it with "acc -ss" and set "batt</em>status<em>override=Idle". This means, when "main/cool</em>mode" is "on" (0), <em>status will be determined by the not</em>charging function (as usual), but when it's off (1), <em>status will be Idle, bypassing the not</em>charging function.</p>

<p>// If the user were to write their own logic, it would be something like the following:
// batt<em>status</em>override='[ $(cat main/cool_mode) -eq 1 ] &amp;&amp; printf Idle || :'
// The "|| :" part is mandatory to avoid issues with "set -e", which acc uses extensively.</p>

<p>// batt<em>status</em>workaround (bsw) # Default: true
// With this enabled, in addition to just reading POWER<em>SUPPLY</em>STATUS, if the battery is "Charging" and current is within idle<em>threshold (inclusive), battery status is considered "Idle".
// Status is considered "Discharging", if current polarity changes after calling the disable</em>charging function.
// By not relying solely on the information provided by POWER<em>SUPPLY</em>STATUS, this approach dramatically boosts compatibility.
// This must be disabled on systems that report wrong/misleading charging current values.</p>

<p>// capacity<em>mask (cm) # Default: false
// Implies capacity</em>sync.
// This forces Android to report "capacity = (capacity - shutdown <em>capacity) * 100 / (pause</em>capacity - shutdown_capacity)", effectively masking capacity limits.
// It also prevents Android from getting capacity readings below 2%, since some systems shutdown before battery level actually drops to 0%.
// Use case: secretly install acc on a relative's device, and enable this, so that they always see the regular 0-100% battery level scale.</p>

<p>// capacity<em>sync (cs) # Default: auto
// Some devices, notably from the Pixel lineup, have a capacity discrepancy issue between Android's battery service and the kernel.
// capacity</em>sync forces Android to report the actual battery capacity reported by the kernel.
// Besides, it also prevents Android from getting capacity readings below 2%, since some systems shutdown before battery level actually drops to 0%.</p>

<p>// charging_switch (s) # Default: null (automatic)</p>

<p>// If unset, acc cycles through its database and sets the first switch/group that successfully disables charging.
// If later the set switch/group fails, acc unsets it and repeats the above.
// If all switches fail to disable charging, chargingSwitch is unset and acc/d exit with error code 7.</p>

<p>// This automated process can be disabled by appending " --" to the switch/group.
// e.g., acc -s s="battery/charging_enabled 1 0 --"
// "acc -ss" always appends " --".</p>

<p>// charging_switch=milliamps (e.g., 0-250) enables current-based charging control.
// If charging switch is set to 3700-4300 (millivolts), acc stops charging by limiting voltage.
// For details, refer to the readme's tips section.</p>

<p>// Unlike the original variant, this kind of switch is never unset automatically.
// Thus, in this case, appending " --" to it leads to invalid syntax.</p>

<p>// Unless charging is enabled first, a daemon restart is required after changing this setting (automated by "acc --set" (synchronous), but not by "acca --set" (asynchronous)).</p>

<p>// cooldown<em>capacity (cc) # Default: 50
// Battery level or millivolts at which the cooldown cycle starts.
// Cooldown reduces battery stress induced by prolonged exposure to high temperature and high charging voltage.
// It does so through periodically pausing charging for a few seconds (cooldown</em>pause, more details below).
// Requires cooldown<em>current or cooldown</em>charge and cooldown_pause, explained next.</p>

<p>// cooldown<em>charge (cch) # Default: null
// cooldown</em>pause (cp) # Default: null</p>

<p>// Those two dictate the cooldown cycle intervals (seconds).
// When not set, the cycle is disabled, unless cooldown<em>current is set.
// Suggested values are cch=50 and cp=10.
// If charging gets a bit slower than desired, try cch=50 and cp=5.
// Note that cooldown</em>capacity and cooldown<em>temp can be disabled individually by assigning them values that would never be reached under normal circumstances.
// cooldown</em>current optionally works with ratios as well (cooldown<em>charge: regular current, cooldown</em>pause: cooldown_current).</p>

<p>// cooldown<em>current (cdc) # Default: null
// Instead of pausing charging for cooldown</em>pause seconds, limit the max charging current (e.g., to 500 mA).
// cooldown<em>pause and cooldown</em>charge are optional.
// Note: devices don't support just about any current value. Multiples of 500 mA tend to have higher compatibility.</p>

<p>// cooldown<em>custom (ccu) # Default: null
// When cooldown</em>capacity and/or cooldown_temp don't suit your needs, this comes to the rescue.
// It overrides the regular cooldown settings.</p>

<p>// cooldown<em>temp (ct) # Default: 35
// Temperature (°C) at which the cooldown cycle starts.
// Cooldown reduces the battery degradation rate by lowering the device's temperature.
// Requires cooldown</em>current or cooldown<em>charge and cooldown</em>pause, explained above.</p>

<p>// current<em>workaround (cw) # Default: false
// Only use current control files whose paths match "batt".
// This is necessary only if the current limit affects both input and charging current values (breaking idle mode when charging</em>switch=milliamps).
// Try this if low current values don't work.
// "accd --init" is required after changing this (automated by "acc --set").</p>

<p>// discharge<em>polarity (dp) # Default: null
// This overrides the automatic current polarity (+|-) detection.
// It's only relevant when batt</em>status<em>workaround=true.
// Polarity may change with a kernel upgrade. If this setting is wrong, charging control won't work if batt</em>status_workaround is on.</p>

<p>// force<em>off (fo) # Default: false
// Enable this only if the set charging switch is stubbornly reset by the system.
// Oftentimes, userspace thermal management daemons (e.g., mi</em>thermald) and/or driver issues are behind charging control issues.
// Some people "systemlessly" disable certain thermal daemons with Magisk. While this is not a general recommendation, they swear by it.</p>

<p>// idle<em>threshold (it) # Default: 40
// Current threshold (absolute value) in milliamps to consider _status=Idle (only relevant if batt</em>status_workaround=true).</p>

<p>// lang (l) # Default: en
// Display language, when null, English (en) is assumed.</p>

<p>// max<em>charging</em>current (mcc) # Default: null
// max<em>charging</em>voltage (mcv) # Default: null</p>

<p>// Control files are automatically added.</p>

<p>// Notes:
//   Devices don't support just about any current value. Multiples of 500 mA tend to have higher compatibility.
//   The maximum current that can be set via dedicated commands is 9999 mA. For voltage, the max is 4300 mV. One can override those by manually editing the config.</p>

<p>// max<em>temp (mt) # Default: 50
// resume</em>temp (rt) # Default: 45</p>

<p>// Those two work together and are NOT tied to the cooldown cycle.
// At max<em>temp, charging is paused.
// Charging resumes at resume</em>temp, as long as other conditions (e.g., resume<em>capacity) are also met. To always override resume</em>capacity add r, as in resume_temp=25r.</p>

<p>// off<em>mid (om) # Default: true
// Whether to turn off charging after rebooting the system or restarting accd, if capacity is within resume</em>capacity and pause_capacity.</p>

<p>// one-line scripts # Default: none</p>

<p>// Every line that begins with ":" is interpreted as a shell script.
// This feature can be useful for many things, including setting up persistent config profiles (source a file that overrides the main config).
// All script lines are executed whenever the config is loaded/sourced.
// This happens regularly while the daemon is running, and at least once per command run.</p>

<p>// Note: due to user data encryption, files used in one-line scripts must reside somewhere in /data/adb/, just like acc's own data files. Ignore if your data isn't encrypted.</p>

<p>// Tip: One can schedule tasks with the following construct:
// : sleep profile; at 22:00 'acc -s pc=50 mcc=500 mcv=3900; acc -n "Switched to night profile"'</p>

<p>// pause_capacity (pc) # Default: 75
// Battery level or millivolts at which charging should pause.</p>

<p>// prioritize<em>batt</em>idle_mode (pbim) # Default: true</p>

<p>// Battery idle mode, also called "standby mode" or "charging bypass", is the ability of running off the charger, as if the battery were disconnected from the device.
// Not all devices support this, but there's also emulated idle mode (refer to the readme).
// Emulated idle mode works on all devices.</p>

<p>// If enabled, charging switches that support battery idle mode take precedence.
// This is only relevant when the switch is automatically determined -- i.e., charging_switch is not set or it has no trailing " --".
// In other words, this variable is only used when acc is automatically testing charging switches.</p>

<p>// reboot<em>resume (rr) # Default: false
// Reboot (when capacity capacity is at or below resume</em>capacity) to re-enable charging.
// This is only for devices whose switches can't re-enable charging.
// A warning notification is posted 60 seconds prior, for the user to block the action, if they so please.</p>

<p>// reset<em>batt</em>stats<em>on</em>pause (rbsp) # Default: false
// Reset battery stats after pausing charging.</p>

<p>// reset<em>batt</em>stats<em>on</em>plug (rbspl) # Default: false
// Reset battery stats seconds after plugging the charger.</p>

<p>// reset<em>batt</em>stats<em>on</em>unplug (rbsu) # Default: false
// Reset battery stats seconds after unplugging the charger.</p>

<p>// resume_capacity (rc) # Default: 15
// Battery level or millivolts at which charging should resume.</p>

<p>// run<em>cmd</em>on<em>pause (rcp) # Default: null
// Run commands* after pausing charging.
// * Usually a script ("sh some</em>file" or ". some_file")</p>

<p>// shutdown<em>capacity (sc) # Default: 5
// When the battery is discharging, its level/millivolts is at or below shutdown</em>capacity, and the device has been running for 15 minutes or more, acc daemon turns the device off to reduce the discharge rate, and protect the battery from potential damage, induced by voltage below the operating range.
// A value of -1 disables it.</p>

<p>// shutdown_temp (st) # Default: 55
// Shutdown the system if battery temperature >= this value.</p>

<p>// temp_level (tl) # Default: 0
// This is a current limiting hack.
// Some devices have adjustable "temperature levels". At the highest level, charging current is blocked.
// The stock values are generally integers, ranging from 0 to 6, 7 or so.
// For greater flexibility, this variable stores a percentage value -- which is internally mapped to the system's scales.</p>

<h2>SETUP/USAGE</h2>

<p>As the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> (above) suggests, ACC is designed to run out of the box, with little to no customization/intervention.</p>

<p>The only command you have to remember is <code>acc</code>.
It's a wizard you'll either love or hate.</p>

<p>If you feel uncomfortable with the command line, skip this section and use a front-end app instead.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use a <code>text editor</code> to modify <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc-data/config.txt</code>.
The config file itself has configuration instructions.
Those are the same found in the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> section, above.</p>

<h3>Terminal Commands</h3>

<p>Logs are exported automatically ("--log --export") on exit codes 1, 2 and 7.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Tips</p>

<p>Commands can be chained for extended functionality.
    e.g., charge for 30 minutes, pause charging for 6 hours, charge to 85% and restart the daemon
    acc -e 30m &amp;&amp; acc -d 6h &amp;&amp; acc -e 85 &amp;&amp; accd
  One can take advantage of one-line scripts and the built-in "at" function to schedule profiles (refer back to -c|--config).</p>

<p>Sample profile
    acc -s pc=60 mcc=500 mcv=3900
      This keeps battery capacity between 55-60%, limits charging current to 500 mA and voltage to 3900 millivolts.
      It's great for nighttime and "forever-plugged".</p>

<p>Refer to acc -r (or --readme) for the full documentation (recommended)</p>

<h2>PLUGINS</h2>

<p>Those are scripts that override functions and some global variables.
They should be placed in <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc-data/plugins/</code>.
Files are sorted and sourced.
Filenames shall not contain spaces.
Hidden files and those without the <code>.sh</code> extension are ignored.</p>

<p>There are also <em>volatile</em> plugins (gone on reboot, useful for debugging): <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/plugins/</code>.
Those override the permanent.</p>

<p>A daemon restart is required to load new/modified plugins.</p>

<hr />

<h2>NOTES/TIPS FOR FRONT-END DEVELOPERS</h2>

<h3>Basics</h3>

<p>ACC does not require Magisk.
Any root solution is fine.</p>

<p>Use <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca</code> instead of regular <code>acc</code>.
It's optimized for front-ends, guaranteed to be readily available after installation/upgrades and significantly faster than its <code>acc</code> counterpart.
<code>acca --set prop1=bla prop2="bla bla" ...</code> runs asynchronously (non-blocking mode) - meaning, multiple instances of it work in parallel.</p>

<p>It may be best to use long options over short equivalents - e.g., <code>--set charging_switch=</code> instead of <code>-s s=</code>.
This makes code more readable (less cryptic).</p>

<p>Include provided descriptions of ACC features/settings in your app(s).
Provide additional information (trusted) where appropriate.
Explain settings/concepts as clearly and with as few words as possible.</p>

<p>Take advantage of exit codes.
Refer back to <code>SETUP/USAGE &gt; [Terminal Commands](#terminal-commands) &gt; Exit Codes</code>.</p>

<h3>Installing/Upgrading ACC</h3>

<p>This should be trivial.
The simplest way is flashing acc from Magisk manager.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <code>install.sh</code>, <code>install-online.sh</code> or <code>install-tarball.sh</code> can be used.
For details, refer back to <a href="#install-from-local-source-or-github">install from local source or GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Developers can also use the <em>updateJSON</em> API.
The front-end downloads and parses <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VR-25/acc/master/module.json">this JSON file</a>.
The format is as follows:</p>

<p><code>
{
    "busybox": "https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/busybox-ndk",
    "changelog": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VR-25/acc/master/changelog.md",
    "curl": "https://github.com/Zackptg5/Cross-Compiled-Binaries-Android/tree/master/curl",
    "tgz": "https://github.com/VR-25/acc/releases/download/$version/acc_${version}_${versionCode}.tgz",
    "tgzInstaller": "https://github.com/VR-25/acc/releases/download/$version/install-tarball.sh",
    "version": "STRING",
    "versionCode": INT,
    "zipUrl": "https://github.com/VR-25/acc/releases/download/$version/acc_${version}_${versionCode}.zip"
}
</code></p>

<h3>Uninstalling ACC</h3>

<p>Either run <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/uninstall</code> (no reboot required; <strong>charger must be plugged</strong>) or uninstall from Magisk manager and reboot.</p>

<h3>Initializing ACC</h3>

<p>On boot_completed receiver and main activity, run:</p>

<p><code>[ -f /dev/.vr25/acc/acca ] || /data/adb/vr25/acc/service.sh</code></p>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<p>ACC's working environment must be initialized - i.e., by updating the stock charging config (for restoring without a reboot) and pre-processing data for greater efficiency.
This is done exactly once after boot.
If it were done only after installation/upgrade, one would have to reinstall/upgrade acc after every kernel update.
That's because kernel updates often change the default power supply drivers settings.</p>

<p>Since acc's core executables are dynamic ([expected to] change regularly), those are linked to <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/</code> to preserve the API.
The links must be recreated once after boot (/dev/ is volatile).</p>

<p><code>accd</code> is a symbolic link to <code>service.sh</code>.
If service.sh is executed every time the <code>main activity</code> is launched, accd will be repeatedly restarted for no reason.</p>

<p>Notes</p>

<ul>
<li>This "manual" initialization is only <em>strictly</em> required if Magisk is not installed - and only once per boot session. In other words, Magisk already runs service.sh shortly after boot.</li>
<li>ACC's installer always initializes it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Managing ACC</h3>

<p>As already stated, front-ends should use the executable <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca</code>.
Refer to the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> and <a href="#terminal-commands">terminal commands</a> sections above.</p>

<p>The default config reference has a section entitled variable aliases/shortcuts.
Use ONLY those with <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca --set</code>!</p>

<p>To clarify, <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca --set chargingSwitch=...</code> is not supported!
Use either <code>s</code> or <code>charging_switch</code>.
<code>chargingSwitch</code> and all the other "camelcase" style variables are for internal use only (i.e., private API).</p>

<p>Do not parse the config file directly.
Use <code>--set --print</code> and <code>--set --print-default</code>.
Refer back to <a href="#terminal-commands">terminal commands</a> for details.</p>

<h3>The Output of --info</h3>

<p>It comes from the kernel, not acc itself.
Some kernels provide more information than others.</p>

<p>Most of the lines are either unnecessary (e.g., type: everyone knows that already) or unreliable (e.g., health, speed).</p>

<p>Here's what one should focus on:</p>

<p>HEALTH=Good # Battery health
CAPACITY=50 # Battery level, 0-100
CURRENT<em>NOW=0 # Charging current (Amps)
POWER</em>NOW=0 # (CURRENT<em>NOW * VOLTAGE</em>NOW) (Watts)
STATUS=Charging # Charging, Discharging or Idle (Not charging)
TEMP=281 # Always in (ºC * 10)
VOLTAGE_NOW=3.861 # Charging voltage (Volts)</p>

<p>Note: the power information refers to what is actually supplied to the battery, not what's coming from the adapter.
External power is always converted before it reaches the battery.</p>

<h3>Profiles</h3>

<p>Those are simply different config files.
A config path can be supplied as first argument to <code>acca</code> and second to <code>accd</code> executables.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p><em>Copy the config:</em></p>

<p>Current config: <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca --config cat &gt; /path/to/new/file</code></p>

<p>Default config: <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca /path/to/new/file --version</code> (<code>--version</code> can be replaced with any option + arguments, as seen below.)</p>

<p><em>Edit the copy:</em></p>

<p><code>/dev/.vr25/acc/acca /path/to/new/file --set pause_capacity=75 resume_capacity=70</code> (if the file does not exist, it is created as a copy of the default config.)</p>

<p><em>Use the copy:</em></p>

<p><code>/dev/.vr25/acc/accd --init /path/to/new/file</code> (the daemon is restarted with the new config.)</p>

<p><em>Back to the main config:</em></p>

<p><code>/dev/.vr25/acc/accd --init</code></p>

<h3>More</h3>

<p>ACC daemon does not have to be restarted after making changes to the config.
It picks up new changes within seconds.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>charging_switch</code> (<code>s</code>) requires a daemon restart (<code>/dev/.vr25/acc/accd</code>).</li>
<li><code>current_workaround</code> (<code>cw</code>) requires a full re-initialization (<code>/dev/.vr25/acc/accd --init</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>This information is in the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> section as well.</p>

<p>When Android's battery level differs from that of the kernel, ACC daemon automatically syncs it by stopping the battery service and feeding it the real value every few seconds.</p>

<p>Pixel devices are known for having battery level discrepancies for the longest time.</p>

<p>If your device shuts down before the battery is actually empty, capacity<em>sync or capacity</em>mask may help.
Refer to the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> section above for details.</p>

<h3>Charging Switch</h3>

<p>By default, ACC uses whichever <a href="https://github.com/VR-25/acc/blob/dev/acc/charging-switches.txt">charging switch</a> works ("automatic" charging switch).
However, things don't always go well.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some switches are unreliable under certain conditions (e.g., while display is off).</p></li>
<li><p>Others hold a <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=wakelock">wakelock</a>.
This causes fast battery drain when charging is paused and the device remains plugged.</p></li>
<li><p>Charging keeps being re-enabled by the system, seconds after acc daemon disables it.
As a result, the battery eventually charges to 100% capacity, regardless of pause_capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>High CPU load (drains battery) was also reported.</p></li>
<li><p>In the worst case scenario, the battery status is reported as <code>discharging</code>, while it's actually <code>charging</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In such situations, one has to enforce a switch that works as expected.
Here's how to do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run <code>acc --test</code> (or <code>acc -t</code>) to see which switches work.</li>
<li>Run <code>acc --set charging_switch</code> (or <code>acc -ss</code>) to enforce a working switch.</li>
<li>Test the reliability of the set switch. If it doesn't work properly, try another.</li>
</ol>

<p>Since not everyone is tech savvy, ACC daemon automatically applies settings for certain devices to minimize charging switch issues.
These are in <code>acc/oem-custom.sh</code>.</p>

<h3>Custom Max Charging Voltage And Current Limits</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, not all kernels support these features.
While custom current limits are supported by most (at least to some degree), voltage tweaking support is <em>exceptionally</em> rare.</p>

<p>That said, the existence of potential voltage/current control file doesn't necessarily mean these are writable* or the features, supported.</p>

<p>* Root is not enough.
Kernel level permissions forbid write access to certain interfaces.</p>

<p>Sometimes, restoring the default current may not work without a system reboot.
A workaround is setting the default max current value or any arbitrary high number (e.g., 9000 mA).
Don't worry about frying things.
The device will only draw the max it can take.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: limiting voltage causes battery state of charge (SoC) deviation on some devices.
The  battery management system self-calibrates constantly, though.
Thus, as soon as the default voltage limit is restored, it'll start "fixing" itself.</p>

<p>Limiting current, on the other hand, has been found to be universally safe.
Some devices do not support just any current value, though.
That's not to say out-of-range values cause issues.
These are simply ignored.</p>

<p>If low current values don't work, try setting <code>current_workaround=true</code> (takes effect after <code>accd --init</code>.
Refer to the <a href="#default-configuration">default configuration</a> section for details.</p>

<p>One can override the default lists of max charging current/voltage control files by copying <code>acc/ctrl-files.sh</code> to <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc-data/plugins/</code> and modifying it accordingly.
Note that default limits must be restored prior to that to avoid the need for a system reboot.
Reminder: a daemon restart is required to load new/modified plugins.</p>

<h3>Diagnostics/Logs</h3>

<p>Volatile logs (gone on reboot) are stored in <code>/dev/.vr25/acc/</code> (.log files only).
Persistent logs reside in <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc-data/logs/</code>.</p>

<p><code>acc -le</code> exports all acc logs, plus Magisk's and extras to <code>/data/adb/acc-data/logs/acc-$device_codename.tgz</code>.
The logs do not contain any personal information and are never automatically sent to the developer.
Automatic exporting (local) happens under specific conditions (refer back to <code>SETUP/USAGE &gt; Terminal Commands &gt; Exit Codes</code>).</p>

<h3>Install, Upgrade, Stop and Restart Processes Seem to Take Too Long</h3>

<p>The daemon stop process implies complete reversal of changes made to the charging management system.
Sometimes, <strong>this requires the charger to be plugged</strong>.
That's because some devices have kernel bugs and/or bad charging driver implementations.
That said, accd is always stopped <em>gracefully</em> to ensure the restoration takes place.
One who knows what they're doing, can force-stop accd by running <code>pkill -9 -f accd</code>.</p>

<h3>Kernel Panic and Spontaneous Reboots</h3>

<p>Control files that trigger these are automatically backlisted (commented out in <code>/data/adb/acc-data/logs/write.log</code>).</p>

<h3>Restore Default Config</h3>

<p>This can potentially save a lot of time and grief.</p>

<p><code>acc --set --reset</code>, <code>acc -sr</code> or <code>rm /data/adb/vr25/acc-data/config.txt</code> (failsafe)</p>

<h3>Samsung, Charging <em>Always</em> Stops at 70% Capacity</h3>

<p>This is a device-specific issue (by design?).
It's caused by the <em>store</em>mode_ charging control file.
Switch to <em>batt</em>slate<em>mode</em> to prevent it.
Refer back to <a href="#charging-switch">charging switch</a> above for details on that.</p>

<h3>Slow Charging</h3>

<p>At least one of the following may be the cause:</p>

<ul>
<li>Charging current and/or voltage limits</li>
<li>Cooldown cycle (non optimal charge/pause ratio, try 50/10 or 50/5)</li>
<li>Troublesome charging switch (refer back to <code>TROUBLESHOOTING &gt; Charging Switch</code>)</li>
<li>Weak adapter and/or power cord</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unable to Charge</h3>

<p>Refer back to the <a href="#warnings">warnings</a> section above.</p>

<h3>Unexpected Reboots</h3>

<p>Wrong/troublesome charging control files may trigger unwanted reboots.
ACC blacklist some of these automatically (registered in <code>/data/adb/vr25/acc-data/logs/write.log</code>, with a leading hashtag).
Sometimes, there may be false positives in there - i.e., due to unexpected reboots caused by something else. Thus, if a control file that used to work, suddenly does not, see if it was blacklisted (<code>acc -t</code> also reveals blacklisted switches).
Send <code>write.log</code> to the developer once the reboots have stopped.</p>

<h3>WARP, VOOC and Other Fast Charging Tech</h3>

<p>Charging switches may not work reliably with the original power adapter.
This has nothing to do with acc.
It's bad design by the OEMs themselves.
If you face issues, either try a different charging switch or a regular power brick (a.k.a., slow charger).
You may also want to try stopping charging by limiting current/voltage.</p>

<h3>Why Did accd Stop?</h3>

<p>Run <code>acc -l tail</code> to find out.
This will print the last 10 lines of the daemon log file.</p>

<p>A relatively common exit code is <code>7</code> - meaning all charging switches failed to disable charging.
It happens due to kernel issues (refer to the previous subsection - <a href="#charging-switch">charging switch</a>).
The daemon only stops due to this if acc is set to automatically determine the switches to use (default behavior).
Manually setting a working switch with <code>acc -ss</code> or <code>acc -s s="SWITCHES GO HERE --"</code> disables auto mode and prevents accd from stopping if the set the charging switches fail.</p>

<h2>TIPS</h2>

<h3><em>Always</em> Limit the Charging Current If Your Battery is Old and/or Tends to Discharge Too Fast</h3>

<p>This extends the battery's lifespan and may even <em>reduce</em> its discharge rate.</p>

<p>750-1000mA is a good range for regular use.</p>

<p>500mA is a comfortable minimum - and also very compatible.</p>

<p>If your device does not support custom current limits, use a dedicated ("slow") power adapter.</p>

<h3>Current and Voltage Based Charging Control</h3>

<p>Enabled by setting charging<em>switch=milliamps or charging</em>switch=3700-4300 (millivolts) (e.g., <code>acc -s s=0</code>, <code>acc -s s=250</code>, <code>acc -s s=3900</code>, <code>acc -ss</code> (wizard)).</p>

<p>Essentially, this turns current/voltage control files into <em>[pseudo] charging switches</em>.
Alternatively, one can set a specific current or voltage regulator as charging switch (e.g., acc -s s="battery/current_max 3000000 0").</p>

<p>Note: depending on the device - at <code>pause_capacity</code>, the charging status may either change ("Discharging" or "Idle" ("Not charging") or remain still ("Charging" -- not an issue).</p>

<h3>Generic</h3>

<p>Force fast charge: <code>appy_on_boot="/sys/kernel/fast_charge/force_fast_charge::1::0 usb/boost_current::1::0 charger/boost_current::1::0"</code></p>

<h3>Google Pixel Devices</h3>

<p>Force fast wireless charging with third party wireless chargers that are supposed to charge the battery faster: <code>apply_on_plug=wireless/voltage_max::9000000</code>.</p>

<p>This may not work on all Pixel devices.
There are no negative consequences when it doesn't.</p>

<h3>Override Battery mAh Capacity</h3>

<p>An "extended" battery won't change fully if the kernel still has the stock <code>charge_full_design</code> value.
Some devices allow that to be modified. If that's the case for you, use <code>apply_on_boot</code> to set the desired value(s) in <code>/sys/class/power_supply/*/charge_full_design</code>.</p>

<h3>Override Broken Temperature Sensor</h3>

<p>If your battery's thermistor always reports a negative value, and charging is very slow or even off, see if the following helps:</p>

<p><code>echo ': ; if ${isAccd:-false} &amp;&amp; online; then (for i in */temp_cool */temp_cold; do [ -f $i ] || continue; chown 0:0 $i; chmod 0644 $i; echo "-999" &gt; $i; done); fi || :' &gt;&gt; $(acca -c echo)</code></p>

<h2>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I report issues?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Open issues on GitHub or contact the developer on Facebook, Telegram (preferred) or XDA (links below).
Always provide as much information as possible.
Attach <code>/sdcard/Download/acc-logs-*.tgz</code> - generated by <code>acc -le</code> <em>right after</em> the problem occurs.
Refer back to <code>TROUBLESHOOTING &gt; Diagnostics/Logs</code> for additional details.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why won't you support my device? I've been waiting for ages!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly, have some extra patience!
Secondly, several systems don't have intuitive charging control files; I have to dig deeper - and oftentimes, improvise; this takes time and effort.
Lastly, some systems don't support custom charging control at all;  in such cases, you have to keep trying different kernels and uploading the respective power supply logs.
Refer back to <code>POWER SUPPLY LOGS (HELP NEEDED)</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why, when and how should I calibrate the battery manager?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With modern battery management systems, that's generally unnecessary.</p>

<p>However, if your battery is underperforming, you may want to try the procedure described at https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-603-how-to-calibrate-a-smart-battery .</p>

<p>ACC automatically optimizes system performance and battery utilization, by forcing <code>bg-dexopt-job</code> on daemon [re]start, once after boot, if charging and uptime >= 900 seconds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I set voltage to 4080 mV and that corresponds to just about 75% charge.
But is it typically safer to let charging keep running, or to have the circuits turn on and shut off between defined percentage levels repeatedly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not much about which method is safer.
It's specifically about electron stability: optimizing the pressure (voltage) and current flow.</p>

<p>As long as you don't set a voltage limit higher than 4200 mV, and don't leave the device plugged in for extended periods of time, you're good with that limitation alone.
Otherwise, the other option is actually more beneficial - since it mitigates high pressure (voltage) exposure/time to a greater extent.
If you use both, simultaneously - you get the best of both worlds.
On top of that, if you enable the cooldown cycle, it'll give you even more benefits.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why lithium ion batteries aren't sold fully charged? They're usually ~40-60% charged. Why is that?
Keeping a battery fully drained, almost fully drained or 70%+ charged for a long times, leads to significant (permanent) capacity loss</p>

<p>Putting it all together in practice...</p>

<p>Night/heavy-duty/forever-plugged profile: keep capacity within 40-60% (e.g., acc 50 45) and/or voltage around ~3900 mV</p>

<p>Day/regular profile: max capacity: 75-80% and/or voltage no higher than 4100 mV</p>

<p>Travel profile: capacity up to 95% and/or voltage no higher than 4200 mV</p>

<p>* https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-808-how-to-prolong-lithium-based-batteries/</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't really understand what the "-f|--force|--full [capacity]" is meant for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider the following situation:</p>

<p>You're almost late for an important event.
You recall that I stole your power bank and sold it on Ebay.
You need your device and a good battery backup.
The event will take the whole day and you won't have access to an external power supply in the middle of nowhere.
You need your battery charged fast and as much as possible.
However, you don't want to modify ACC config nor manually stop/restart the daemon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do I have to install/upgrade both ACC and AccA?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To really get out of this dilemma, you have to understand what ACC and AccA essentially are.</p>

<p>ACC is a Android program that controls charging.
It can be installed as an app (e.g., AccA) module, Magisk module or standalone software. Its installer determines the installation path/variant. The user is given the power to override that.</p>

<p>A plain text file holds the program's configuration. It can be edited with any root text editor.
ACC has a command line interface (CLI) - which in essence is a set of Application Programing Interfaces (APIs). The main purpose of a CLI/API is making difficult tasks ordinary.</p>

<p>AccA is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the ACC command line. The main purpose of a GUI is making ordinary tasks simpler.
AccA ships with a version of ACC that is automatically installed when the app is first launched.</p>

<p>That said, it should be pretty obvious that ACC is like a fully autonomous car that also happens to have a steering wheel and other controls for a regular driver to hit a tree.
Think of AccA as a robotic driver that often prefers hitting people over trees.
Due to extenuating circumstances, that robot may not be upgraded as frequently as the car.
Upgrading the car regularly makes the driver happier - even though I doubt it has any emotion to speak of.
The back-end can be upgraded by flashing the latest ACC zip.
However, unless you have a good reason to do so, don't fix what's not broken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does acc work also when Android is off?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, but this possibility is being explored.
Currently, it does work in recovery mode, though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have this wakelock as soon as charging is disabled. How do I deal with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best solution is enforcing a charging switch that doesn't trigger a wakelock.
Refer back to <code>TROUBLESHOOTING &gt; Charging Switch</code>.
A common workaround is having <code>resume_capacity = pause_capacity - 1</code>. e.g., resume<em>capacity=74, pause</em>capacity=75.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What's idle mode, and how do I set it up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's the ability of running off the charger.
The battery behaves as if it were physically disconnected from the device.
The primary indicator of idle mode is charging current around 0 mA. One can customize idleThreshold (absolute value).</p>

<p>Idle mode is great for extended device use (e.g., GPS navigation, gaming, server). Use it when the charger must be plugged for a long time (or permanently).</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: lithium batteries have the longest lifespan when kept about 40-60% charged (about 3.7-3.9ish Volts). That said, try not to use idle mode above 60% too often.</p>

<p>Not all devices support the "native" idle mode. Hence, variants of "emulated" idle mode are available:</p>

<ol>
<li>Limit the charging voltage (requires kernel support) to a value that gets you close to the desired battery level. To avoid false positives, determine the value only after the device has been unplugged for a minute or so.</li>
<li>Pause/resume charging based on voltage thresholds (e.g., acc 3900 keeps voltage within 3850 and 3900 millivolts).</li>
<li>Set resume<em>capacity to (pause</em>capacity - 1), e.g., acc 50 49.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes</p>

<ul>
<li>In idle mode, the battery does discharge, although very slowly. The same happens to a battery that is sitting on a shelf.</li>
<li>In emulated idle mode, the battery tends to hold its charge, since it works as a "passthrough" device. Imagine pouring water into a glass that is already full.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>How do I enable "smart charging"?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Configure day and night profiles:</p>

<p><code>acc -c a ": day profile; at 6:00 \"acc -s pc=75 mcc= mcv=4100; acc -n 'Switched to day profile'\""; acc -c a ": night profile; at 22:00 \"acc -s pc=50 mcc=500 mcv=3900; acc -n 'Switched to night profile'\""</code></p>
