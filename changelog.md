- Lower switch test timeout
- Make it possible to post multiple notifications with acc -n
- Make the scheduler safer and aware of the "/dev/" prefix
- Minimize the use of subshells
- Notifications include timestamps
- Overwrite control files values 6 times within a second to wake up lazy switches
- Overwrite control files values upon issuing a disable/enable charging command, regardless of charging status
- Parse current and voltage control files only once per boot session to avoid "false defaults"
- Patches for KSU/Apatch, install notes and "no reboot needed" workaround
- Recommend trying temp_level if no regular current control file is found
- Reduce idle mode false positives when `bsw=true`
- Reinforce uninstall confirmation
- Reset "auto switch" and move it to the end of the list only if unsolicitedResumes = 3, rather than 1
- Reset switch (in auto-mode) if pbim changes via --set
- Reset working-switches.log on a full switch test
- Rewrite battery info logic (acc -i, -w)
- Rewrite discharge_polarity's logic - now dynamic and fully automatic
- Set idleAbovePcap threshold to (pause_capacity + 1)
- Set millivolts idleAbovePcap threshold to (pause_capacity + 50)
- Show applied config patches after upgrades (Android notification)
- Speed up acca --set for voltage and current limits
- Start accd as soon as the lockscreen shows up (no unlocking required)
- Support "," in place of "|" for egrep patterns (e.g., acc -i curr,volt; acc -w curr,volt; acc -sp cap,temp)
- Support cooldown_current with temp_level as back-end (e.g., acc -s cdc=60% to limit current by 60%)
- Support curl binary without --dns-server option (for upgrades)
- Support more devices with unconventional battery interfaces
- Support Nexus 10 (manta)
- Suppress "Terminated" messages
- Suppress missing current control file errors
- Try honoring allowIdleAbovePcap=false only 2x at most, per accd session
- Try wget if curl fails
- Update docs & strings
- Update installer; add magic overlayfs module support
- Update simplified Chinese translations (by @H-xiaoH)

**v2023.10.16 (202310160)**

- accd auto-updates mcc and mcv arrays (missing ctrl files or array[1] "-" marker)
- Added dev tag to update checker
- Additional charging switches
- Additional current control files
- allowIdleAbovePcap=true, if set to false, accd will avoid idle mode (if possible) when capacity > pause_capacity
- Auto-move failing switches to the end of the list
- Default acc -w refresh rate set to 1 second
- Default capacity_sync set to false
- Dropped obsolete code & information
- Ensure charging switch is set before a pause condition is hit
- Fixed html hyperlinks and duplicate temp in acc -i (OnePlus 7)
- Implement "rt ct mt" restricted charging hysteresis
- Improved current control files parsing & automatic switch logic
- KaiOS support
- Log export function invokes Android's share dialog
- Optimized loop delays (loopDelay=(3 9): 3 seconds while charging/idle, 9 seconds while discharging)
- prioritizeBattIdleMode=no has the opposite effect (prioritize non-idle mode)
- Refactored battery health calculator and cooldown logic
- resume_temp and cooldown_temp optionally override resume_capacity (if resume_temp has a trailing "r", as in resume_temp=35r)
- Selection lists count from 0 instead of 1
- Show /dev/ prefix tip only if acc is not in $PATH
- Suspend regular daemon functions until discharge_polarity is set, either automatically or manually
